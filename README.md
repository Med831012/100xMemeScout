## **🔍 How It Works**
1. **Data Fetching**  
   The system collects data from multiple sources, including:
   - **Solana Blockchain:** On-chain metrics such as wallet activity and token transactions.
   - **DEXs:** Token prices, liquidity pools, and trading volume.
   - **Social Media:** Frequency and sentiment of mentions for specific tokens.  

2. **Analysis**  
   - **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses natural language processing (NLP) to assess the buzz around memecoins.
   - **Market Metrics:** Identifies tokens with a healthy combination of liquidity, market cap, and wallet growth.  

3. **Scoring System**  
   Each token is ranked based on a composite score derived from:
   - **Virality:** Social media mentions, trends, and memes.
   - **Market Health:** Trading volume, liquidity, and market cap.
   - **Community Activity:** Growth in holders, transactions, and developer engagement.  

4. **Output**  
   - The top tokens are displayed in an easy-to-read dashboard with supporting metrics and links.
